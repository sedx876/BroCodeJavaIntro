		//modified, essentially, a constant. This also means that you must initialize a final variable. 
		//If the final variable is a reference, this means that the variable cannot be re-bound to 
		//reference another object, but internal state of the object pointed by that reference 
		//variable can be changed i.e. you can add or remove elements from final array or final 
		//collection. It is good practice to represent final variables in all uppercase, using 
		//underscore to separate words.
